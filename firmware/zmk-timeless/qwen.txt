  1. Applied Hold-Tap Parameter Optimizations
   - Updated miryoku_behaviors.dtsi with optimized parameters as recommended:
     - Set flavor = "balanced" for HRMs with positional triggers
     - Increased tapping-term-ms to 280ms for HRMs (and 175ms for layer taps)
     - Added quick-tap-ms = <175> for utility key repetition
     - Set require-prior-idle-ms = <200> for typing streak enforcement
     - Implemented positional logic with hold-trigger-key-positions for bilateral chording
     - Enabled hold-trigger-on-release for reliable same-hand modifier combinations

  2. Enhanced Home Row Mod (HRM) Configuration
   - Left HRMs now trigger hold only when keys on the right side are pressed (and vice versa)
   - Right HRMs configured with opposite positional triggers for cross-hand chording
   - Added positional hold-tap configurations for layer-tap keys as well

  3. Updated Custom Configuration
   - Modified custom_config.h to use the optimized positional HRM configuration (U_MTL/U_MTR macros)
   - Updated U_TAPPING_TERM to 175ms for non-HRM dual-role keys
   - Commented out the legacy non-positional HRM configuration

  4. Applied Kconfig Debounce Settings
   - Added optimized debounce settings in corne.conf:
     - CONFIG_ZMK_KSCAN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS_MS=5
     - CONFIG_ZMK_KSCAN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE_MS=5

  5. Successfully Built Firmware
   - Both left and right Corne firmware built successfully
   - Generated new UF2 files with timestamp 202510050602
   - Settings reset firmware also generated

  Key Improvements Implemented:
   1. "Timeless" HRM Paradigm: Decoupled tap latency from timing constraints using event-driven resolution
   2. Bilateral Enforcement: Cross-hand modifiers trigger instantly while preventing same-hand chording
   3. Typing Streak Protection: require-prior-idle-ms ensures instant tap resolution during active typing
   4. Chord Management: hold-trigger-on-release enables complex same-hand modifier combinations

  The firmware now implements the "Timeless" HRM philosophy with event-driven, context-aware resolution that eliminates the need for "mind
  timers" while providing reliable modifier activation for intentional cross-hand chording.
