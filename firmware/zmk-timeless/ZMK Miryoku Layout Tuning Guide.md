# **Advanced Firmware Architecture Report: Optimizing ZMK Hold-Tap Parameters for Miryoku Home Row Modifiers**

## **I. Executive Summary: Optimized Miryoku ZMK Tuning Profile**

The implementation of Home Row Modifiers (HRMs) within highly compact, layered keyboard layouts such as Miryoku presents a fundamental challenge in dual-role key resolution: differentiating between an intentional single-character tap and an intended modifier hold during high-speed typing. Traditional firmware approaches rely heavily on temporal separation via a strict tapping-term-ms, which inevitably introduces cognitive load and unacceptable input latency.  
The optimized ZMK tuning paradigm detailed in this report shifts the core objective from optimizing temporal constraints to leveraging context-aware, event-driven resolution mechanisms. The primary strategy involves the deliberate decoupling of tap latency from the hold time measurement, achieved through the aggressive deployment of two key components: the require-prior-idle-ms parameter for typing streak enforcement, and positional logic defined by hold-trigger-key-positions and hold-trigger-on-release for bilateral combination enforcement.

### **Key HRM Optimization Recommendation (Devicetree Parameters)**

For optimal, high-accuracy Miryoku implementation, the dual-role key behavior nodes should be customized in the Devicetree:

* **Flavor:** The flavor should be set to either "tap-preferred" for maximum tap assurance, or "balanced" when intentional same-hand chording is desired, provided that robust positional triggers are implemented.  
* **tapping-term-ms:** This value should be set generously long, typically in the range of 250 milliseconds (ms) to 300 ms.1 This long duration is a calculated strategy: it reduces the time pressure on the user and allows the event-driven triggers (positional logic) to supersede the temporal check for nearly all intended modifier uses.  
* **require-prior-idle-ms:** This parameter is critical for typing streak enforcement, establishing a decay period typically set between 150 ms and 230 ms.1 This ensures taps resolve instantaneously during active typing, effectively eliminating the primary source of latency associated with HRMs.  
* **Positional Logic:** The crucial deployment of hold-trigger-key-positions and hold-trigger-on-release enables cross-hand modification without accidental same-hand chording, providing reliable bilateral modifier enforcement.1

This optimized tuning achieves a "mind-timer"-free typing environment, maximizing the consistency of the Tap action during active input and guaranteeing the Hold action only when contextually appropriate, thereby significantly reducing error rates and cognitive overhead.

## **II. Foundational Mechanics of ZMK Hold-Tap Behavior**

### **A. Anatomy of Dual-Role Keys: The ZMK Hold-Tap Behavior Model**

The ZMK firmware manages dual-role keys through specific behavioral components designed to invoke different actions based on timing or concurrent key presses. The two principal behaviors utilized in layered layouts are the Mod-Tap (\&mt), typically used for embedding modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Super) into standard character keys, and the Layer-Tap (\<), which toggles or activates auxiliary layers.1 Both are instances of the fundamental Hold-Tap behavior.4  
The core difficulty in utilizing dual-role keys, especially in densely packed layouts like Miryoku, is the necessity for the firmware to decide rapidly whether a single key press should result in the transmission of the *tap* action (e.g., the character 'A') or the activation of the *hold* action (e.g., the modifier Control). This decision must be made within a minuscule window of time to prevent input lag or, conversely, accidental modifier activation (misfires).1 This requirement necessitates the use of custom behaviors defined in the Devicetree, which allow granular control over resolution parameters that the default  
\&mt or \< nodes may not provide.1

### **B. The Role of Time: tapping-term-ms and Latency**

The tapping-term-ms property dictates the maximum duration a key can be held down while still resolving as a tap, under certain conditions defined by the chosen flavor. The default value for both the Mod-Tap and Layer-Tap behaviors in ZMK is 200 ms.1 If a key is held beyond this duration, the system resolves the press as a Hold, potentially triggering the modifier or layer function.1  
A short tapping-term-ms, such as 150 ms, requires the user to execute an exceptionally fast key press-and-release cycle to register a tap. While faster, this creates significant susceptibility to accidental Hold activations (misfires), especially for users with varied or non-uniform typing styles. Conversely, extending the tapping-term-ms significantly—for instance, to 300 ms 2—reduces the speed requirement for the tap action but introduces substantial latency, because if the Hold decision relies solely on time (as with the  
"tap-preferred" flavor), the system must wait the full 300 ms before confirming and sending the Hold action.  
The strategic resolution to this conflict lies in recognizing that true optimization requires the system to completely *decouple* the perceived tap latency from the measured duration of the tapping-term-ms. This decoupling is achieved by utilizing event-based interruption mechanisms to trigger the Hold instantaneously, or, more importantly for typing speed, to resolve the Tap action immediately upon press without waiting for any time-out. Consequently, a deliberately long tapping-term-ms (250–300 ms) becomes beneficial, serving not as a time-based accelerator, but as a safety net that forces the user to deliberately invoke an *interrupting event* (pressing another key, particularly on the opposing hand) to confirm the intended modifier action. This configuration shifts the decision mechanism away from the timer and toward intentionality, improving the overall typing flow.2

### **C. Instantaneous Resolution Mechanisms: quick-tap-ms for Repetition Use Cases**

While tapping-term-ms manages the initial tap/hold distinction, the quick-tap-ms property is designed to enhance fluidity for key repetition scenarios. By default, this behavior is disabled.1 When enabled, if a dual-role key (which previously resolved as a tap) is pressed again within the defined  
quick-tap-ms period, the subsequent press will *always* resolve as a tap, even if the key is held down beyond the primary tapping-term-ms.1  
This mechanism is highly effective not for the primary alphabetical Home Row Modifiers, but for utility keys found on mod layers, such as Backspace, Delete, or navigation controls. In these contexts, a common pattern involves a quick tap followed immediately by a sustained hold to initiate rapid repetition (e.g., tapping backspace once, then holding it down to delete a block of text). Setting a moderate quick-tap-ms, typically between 150 ms and 175 ms, significantly improves the responsiveness and user experience for these specific applications.1

## **III. Disambiguation Flavors: Selection for Miryoku HRMs**

### **A. Theoretical Framework of Interrupt Flavors**

The flavor property is the most critical determinant of how a Hold-Tap key behaves when an external event—the pressing of an adjacent or secondary key, known as an "interrupt"—occurs before the tapping-term-ms has expired.1 The choice of flavor defines the decision-making logic and directly impacts the susceptibility to misfires and the responsiveness of the modifier activation.

### **B. Comparative Analysis of the Four Flavors**

ZMK defines four primary interrupt flavors, each exhibiting distinct behavior when an interrupting key is pressed:

1. **"hold-preferred" flavor:** This is the default ZMK behavior. It triggers the hold action when the tapping-term-ms expires **or** immediately when *any* other key is pressed.1 This behavior is functionally equivalent to QMK's  
   HOLD\_ON\_OTHER\_KEY\_PRESS setting.1 While useful for isolated keys like  
   Ctrl/Escape, this flavor is generally too aggressive for Home Row Modifiers in a high-density layout. The frequent slight overlaps in finger travel during fast typing will prematurely trigger the modifier, rendering it unsuitable for reliable HRMs.  
2. **"balanced" flavor:** Often referred to as the ZMK equivalent of QMK's PERMISSIVE\_HOLD.1 This flavor triggers the hold action when the  
   tapping-term-ms expires **or** when another key is pressed **and then released** while the hold-tap key remains depressed.1 This sequence—hold a modifier, tap a character, release the character, then release the modifier—matches the intuitive use of modifiers most of the time.1 For Layer-Taps,  
   "balanced" is a strong candidate as it permissively enters the layer as soon as the next key is tapped, facilitating rapid layer switching. However, for HRMs, if used alone, it can still lead to misfires during rapid sequences performed on the same hand, breaking typing rhythm.3  
3. **"tap-preferred" flavor:** This flavor is functionally the QMK default. It exhibits the highest resistance to interruption, triggering the hold action **only** when the tapping-term-ms has fully expired.1 Crucially, pressing another key within the tapping term does  
   *not* immediately force a hold decision.1 This reliance solely on duration ensures the highest safety margin against accidental hold activation during typing streaks, making it one of the safest flavors for maintaining tap integrity in HRMs. The inherent latency associated with waiting for the term to expire is overcome by the inclusion of streak-detection and positional logic, as detailed in Section IV.  
4. **"tap-unless-interrupted" flavor:** This specialized flavor inverts the logic. It triggers a hold only if interrupted *before* the tapping-term-ms expires, resolving to a tap in all other situations. This behavior is rarely utilized for standard Miryoku HRMs.1

### **C. Strategic Flavor Selection for Home Row Modifiers (HRMs) vs. Layer Taps (LTs)**

The strategic selection of the flavor is dependent on the role of the dual-action key and the accompanying timing parameters.  
**Layer Tap (LT) Recommendation:** For keys primarily used for rapid layer switching, "balanced" is generally the preferred choice. It ensures the layer is activated reliably the moment the user initiates the first key press within that new layer, offering rapid permissive layer entry.  
**Home Row Modifier (HRM) Recommendation (The Nuance):** The primary goal for HRMs is to maximize tap resolution speed during alphabetical streaks while allowing intentional cross-hand chords to be executed instantly. Highly reliable tap resolution during active typing is paramount. Experts often advocate for **"tap-preferred"** or a finely tuned **"balanced"** flavor, but crucially, these must be paired with an exceptionally high tapping-term-ms (e.g., 280–300 ms) and the enabling of positional triggers and idle enforcement mechanisms.1  
The decision framework dictates that if the implementation relies heavily on positional logic to enforce cross-hand modification, the flavor's direct interrupt mechanism becomes secondary. A very long tapping-term-ms ensures that the time limit is irrelevant for intentional actions, which are immediately resolved by the positional logic. In this case, "tap-preferred" offers the maximum tap assurance because it ignores accidental key presses within the time window. Conversely, "balanced" is chosen if the user specifically needs the permissive hold behavior (where the Hold decision is triggered by the subsequent key's release) or wishes to enable specific same-hand modifier combinations (e.g., Ctrl+Shift on the same hand followed by a tap on the opposite hand).3  
Table 1: Comparison of ZMK Hold-Tap Interrupt Flavors for Ergonomic Use

| Flavor Name | Hold Trigger Condition | QMK Equivalent | Miryoku HRM Suitability | Typing Feel Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "hold-preferred" | tapping-term-ms expires OR *any* key press. | HOLD\_ON\_OTHER\_KEY\_PRESS | Low | Highly aggressive hold; poor for high WPM. |
| "balanced" | tapping-term-ms expires OR other key pressed *and released*. | PERMISSIVE\_HOLD | Medium-High (Requires positional logic for safety). | Permissive hold; good for standard mod use. |
| "tap-preferred" | Only when tapping-term-ms expires. | QMK Default | High (Safest for tap streaks; latency managed by require-prior-idle-ms). | Responsive tap; pure time dependency. |
| "tap-unless-interrupted" | Only when interrupted *before* tapping-term-ms expires. | N/A | Low (Specialized use). | Inverted timing logic. |

## **IV. Optimization Strategies for Home Row Modifiers (HRMs)**

Reliable implementation of Miryoku HRMs necessitates specific, event-driven strategies to override the limitations of simple time-based resolution, addressing the two major failure modes: misfires during fast typing streaks and ambiguity during same-hand key rolls.

### **A. Mitigating Typing Streak Interference: The Critical Function of require-prior-idle-ms**

Typing streaks—the continuous, rapid succession of character presses—are the primary source of unintentional modifier activation.3 During fast typing, the minimal overlap in key presses can easily confuse a time-based or permissive flavor, resulting in a misfire (e.g., accidentally closing a window instead of typing a letter).  
The require-prior-idle-ms property is the definitive defense against this phenomenon, functioning as a typing streak enforcement mechanism.1 This property defines a decay period. If the hold-tap key is pressed within this duration after any other  
**non-modifier key** was pressed, the hold-tap will automatically and instantly resolve as a tap.1 This mechanism proactively suppresses unintended modifier activation precisely when the user is engaged in active text input.  
Optimal values for require-prior-idle-ms range from 125 ms up to 230 ms.1 A setting of 150 ms is a standard baseline, as it ensures that dual-role keys resolve to taps immediately when typing at typical speeds, which significantly helps to eliminate perceived input delay.1 For faster typists, increasing this value to 200 ms or 230 ms ensures a longer grace period after a dense key sequence, guaranteeing that the system favors the tap action and maintains typing rhythm.3  
The implementation of require-prior-idle-ms offers a significant architectural advantage: by forcing an immediate tap resolution if a streak is detected, this mechanism effectively bypasses the latent wait time imposed by the tapping-term-ms. This means that during active typing, the user experiences near-zero tap latency, as the decision is made instantly on the key down event based on recent typing context, rather than waiting for any timer to expire.1

### **B. Positional Hold-Tap Implementation: Enabling Intentional Bilateral Chording**

The second major implementation challenge involves resolving same-hand chording, where letter rolls trigger unintended modifiers (e.g., pressing 'c' and 'k' in rapid succession, both on the left hand, unintentionally registering Control+K).3  
The solution in ZMK is the use of **bilateral enforcement** via positional hold-taps. This is achieved by utilizing the hold-trigger-key-positions property.1 This property accepts an array of key position indexes. When positional hold-tap is enabled, if the user presses any key  
*not* included in this list before the tapping-term-ms expires, the dual-role key resolves as a tap.1  
To implement reliable Miryoku HRMs on a split keyboard:

1. For the left-hand HRMs (L-Shift, L-Ctrl, etc.), the hold-trigger-key-positions list must exclusively contain all key positions on the right side of the keyboard.  
2. For the right-hand HRMs, the list must contain all key positions on the left side.

This setup enforces **cross-hand modifiers**. The system instantly recognizes a press of an opposing hand key as an intention to hold the modifier, bypassing the long tapping-term-ms. Crucially, this setup allows rapid, successive presses of letters on the *same hand* without accidentally triggering the modifier, as the interrupting key is not in the designated trigger list.1  
A critical component of this positional logic is the setting of hold-trigger-on-release to true.1 If this property is disabled (the default), the hold decision is finalized instantly upon the  
*press* of the interrupting key. By enabling it, the hold decision is delayed until the *release* of the interrupting key.1 This delay is fundamental for complex modifier usage. It allows a user to hold down multiple modifiers on one hand (e.g., Left Shift and Left Control) and then tap or hold a character key on the opposite hand, ensuring both modifiers are applied simultaneously for complex chords (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+A). This accommodates the ability to use necessary same-hand modifier combinations.1

### **C. The "Timeless" HRM Paradigm**

The strategies described above—long time terms, aggressive idle detection, and positional triggers—represent a practical embodiment of the "Timeless" Home Row Mods philosophy popularized by developers like Urob.10 The objective of "Timeless" HRMs is to remove the reliance on arbitrary, burdensome "mind timers" from the user's workflow, instead making modifier resolution entirely event-driven and context-aware.11  
In this paradigm, the system resolves the key action based on the state of the typing stream and the position of subsequently pressed keys, rather than strict time limits. The key observation is that reliable taps require the system to ignore time when actively typing (require-prior-idle-ms), and reliable holds require an immediate, event-driven confirmation (positional triggers). The high tapping-term-ms is merely a fallback, effectively removed from the critical decision path. Although advanced "Timeless" implementations sometimes incorporate custom macros or non-standard ZMK features (like global-quick-tap-ms for enhanced combo safety) 12, the robust combination of vanilla ZMK parameters described here achieves the core latency and accuracy benefits desired for Miryoku.

## **V. Configuration Prescriptions and Actionable Recommendations**

Configuration changes must be applied at compile time within the Devicetree structure of the ZMK keymap file (.keymap) or a custom configuration file (\<name\>.keymap), as ZMK configuration is set during the firmware build process.13

### **A. Optimized Devicetree Node Definitions for Miryoku HRMs**

To achieve the desired low-latency, low-error profile for Home Row Modifiers, custom hold-tap behaviors must be defined. The following snippet illustrates the definition of a Left Home Row Mod behavior (hml), which can be reused across all primary modifier keys on that side:

Snippet di codice

/ {  
    behaviors {  
        hml: home\_row\_mod\_left {  
            compatible \= "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";  
            \#binding-cells \= ;  
            flavor \= "balanced";  /\* Recommended for use with positional triggers \*/  
            tapping-term-ms \= ;  
            quick-tap-ms \= ;  
            require-prior-idle-ms \= ;  
            bindings \= \<\&kp\>, \<\&kp\>;  
            hold-trigger-key-positions \= \< /\* Array of all Right Hand Key Position Indexes \*/ \>;  
            hold-trigger-on-release;  
        };

        hmr: home\_row\_mod\_right {  
            compatible \= "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";  
            \#binding-cells \= ;  
            flavor \= "balanced";  
            tapping-term-ms \= ;  
            quick-tap-ms \= ;  
            require-prior-idle-ms \= ;  
            bindings \= \<\&kp\>, \<\&kp\>;  
            hold-trigger-key-positions \= \< /\* Array of all Left Hand Key Position Indexes \*/ \>;  
            hold-trigger-on-release;  
        };  
    };  
};

**Analysis of Parameter Choices:** The tapping-term-ms is elevated to 280 ms, ensuring that accidental holds due to timing inaccuracies are nearly impossible.1 This duration is effectively bypassed for intended cross-hand chords by the positional trigger list. The  
require-prior-idle-ms is set to 200 ms, establishing a robust window to guarantee tap resolution during active typing streaks.1 A moderate  
quick-tap-ms (175 ms) is included to facilitate secondary repetition functions on utility keys.1 Finally, the  
hold-trigger-on-release setting is mandatory to ensure complex modifier combinations are correctly registered.1

### **B. Optimized Devicetree Node Definitions for Layer-Taps (LTs)**

Layer-Tap keys, frequently used on thumb clusters in Miryoku, are optimized for rapid layer access rather than complex modifier chording. They rarely conflict with alphabetical typing streaks in the same manner as HRMs.  
For Layer-Taps (\<), the recommended optimization strategy focuses on quicker engagement and permissive behavior:

1. **tapping-term-ms:** A moderate duration of 150 ms to 200 ms is appropriate, facilitating rapid layer activation without excessive latency.1  
2. **flavor:** The "balanced" flavor is preferred, as it allows the layer to be activated as soon as the user taps the first key on the new layer, which is the expected workflow for layer navigation.  
3. **require-prior-idle-ms:** This can typically be omitted or set to a low value (e.g., 50–100 ms), as LTs are less likely to interfere with the dense stream of character input.

### **C. Configuration of Kconfig Debounce Settings for Low Latency**

The ultimate perceived input latency is a composite of behavioral latency (managed by hold-tap parameters) and physical hardware scanning latency. ZMK utilizes Kconfig parameters, often defined in the board's configuration file (\<board\>.conf or \<name\>.conf), to control physical input characteristics.13  
ZMK offers global debouncing options: CONFIG\_ZMK\_KSCAN\_DEBOUNCE\_PRESS\_MS and CONFIG\_ZMK\_KSCAN\_DEBOUNCE\_RELEASE\_MS.15 The default debounce time is typically 5 ms. Although this seems low, optimizing this value is critical for minimizing micro-latency at the physical input level. For optimal responsiveness, these values should be kept as low as possible while still ensuring reliable key registration (often remaining at 5 ms or lower if hardware permits).15  
For keyboard matrix drivers, ZMK often utilizes a polling interval, which can default to 25 ms.16 Maintaining extremely low debounce settings maximizes the effective responsiveness within this polling cycle, contributing to the overall "snappiness" of the typing experience. Achieving low overall latency requires minimizing both the delay associated with complex modifier decision logic and the physical latency inherent in key scanning and debouncing.17  
Table 2: Recommended Parameter Ranges for Miryoku Dual-Role Keys in ZMK

| Parameter | Critical HRM Keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) | Layer-Tap Keys (LT) | Impact Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| flavor | "tap-preferred" or "balanced" | "balanced" | Prioritizes tap safety/time dependency or permissive layer entry. |
| tapping-term-ms | **250 – 300 ms** (Long) | **150 – 200 ms** (Moderate) | Decouples latency from term; relies on events for HRM holds; allows reliable time-out for LTs. |
| require-prior-idle-ms | **150 – 230 ms** (High priority) | **50 – 100 ms** or Disabled | Essential for instantaneous tap resolution during high WPM typing streaks. |
| hold-trigger-on-release | **True** (Required with positional logic) | False (Default often acceptable) | Enables reliable same-hand modifier chording and cross-hand mod application. |
| quick-tap-ms | **150 – 175 ms** | **150 – 175 ms** | Supports intentional tap-then-hold sequences for key repetition. |

## **VI. Conclusion and Future ZMK Behavior Considerations**

The analysis demonstrates that optimizing ZMK for the Miryoku layout requires a fundamental shift in how dual-role key resolution is approached. Relying on short time constraints introduces pervasive cognitive latency and misfire susceptibility. The superior strategy involves treating home row modifier usage as an **interrupt problem**, rather than a *timing* problem.  
The optimized configuration prescribes the use of a generously long tapping-term-ms (250–300 ms) as a temporal safety measure. The crucial performance gains are derived from three simultaneous, event-driven components:

1. **Streak Detection (require-prior-idle-ms):** Immediately resolves a key press as a tap if it occurs during an active typing sequence, guaranteeing near-zero tap latency during high-speed text entry.  
2. **Bilateral Enforcement (Positional Logic):** Instantly resolves a key press as a hold if an interrupting key is detected on the opposite hand, bypassing the long time term entirely for intentional cross-hand chords.  
3. **Chord Management (hold-trigger-on-release):** Delays the final hold resolution until the release of the interrupting key, preserving the ability to execute complex, intentional combinations of same-hand modifiers.

By implementing this configuration, users can successfully eliminate the pervasive ambiguity that plagues simplistic HRM setups. The result is a highly responsive keyboard environment where the firmware’s behavior mirrors the user’s intent, whether the key is part of a rapid alphabetical streak or an intentional modifier chord. While the current vanilla ZMK behaviors provide sufficient tools for this optimization, ongoing development in the ZMK community—particularly the exploration of enhanced chord and sequence analysis features exemplified by the "Timeless" philosophy—indicates a future where such context-aware resolutions become even more deeply integrated into the core firmware, further reducing the reliance on any temporal dependency for accurate input.12
